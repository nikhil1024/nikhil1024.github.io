I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at Indiana University Bloomington. My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

My goal is to create AI applications that will help improve our way of living. Right from getting recommendations about what to watch next on Netflix to asking our Google Assistant whether we need to carry an umbrella today, AI plays an important role in our lives. Yet the challenge of AI is far from solved. AI lacks reasoning and common sense knowledge. If we could solve these challenges, we could have a much richer experience and most of our day-to-day chores could potentially be handled by AI.
