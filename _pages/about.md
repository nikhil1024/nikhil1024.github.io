I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at Indiana University Bloomington. My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

My goal is to create AI applications that will help improve our way of living. Right from getting recommendations about what to watch next on Netflix to asking our Google Assistant whether we need to carry an umbrella today, AI plays an important role in our lives. Yet the challenge of AI is far from solved. AI lacks reasoning and common sense knowledge. If we could solve these challenges, we could have a much richer experience and most of our day-to-day chores could potentially be handled by AI.

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Engineering from K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering in India. My capstone project was to make an intelligent software to provide a walking aid to the visually impaired. The deep learning based model would inform the user about the obstalces (such as table, chair, etc.) that are in their path, which would help the user walk with ease.

Apart from Technology, I love to play Soccer and Table-Tennis. I love to explore new places and try out different cuisines.
