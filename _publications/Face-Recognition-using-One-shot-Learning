excerpt: 'Abstract: Face Recognition represents one of the attractive research
areas. It has drawn the attention of many researchers due to its
varying applications such as security, healthcare, marketing,
identity authentication, surveillance etc. In this order, different
face recognition algorithms have been proposed however, one
algorithm that stands out in the event of limited dataset is one
shot learning. “One shot” means learning from a single
training item. This paper discusses a way for solving this
problem. Neural networks are notorious for requiring
extremely large datasets to reach a considerable accuracy.
This paper proposes a method to solve this problem for the
face recognition domain by bringing down the number of
training samples required to just one and still achieving a
decent accuracy close to 90%.'
